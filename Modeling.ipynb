    "The Make_Pickle function encapsulates the final step in the predictive modeling process: saving the optimal model for future application. By serializing the chosen model into a binary file using Python's pickle module, this function ensures that the model can be easily and efficiently reloaded for subsequent predictions, without the need to retrain. The naming convention for the output file incorporates both the ticker symbol and the interval for which the model was developed, facilitating straightforward identification and retrieval of the model. This step is crucial for operationalizing the model in practical financial analysis scenarios, allowing for quick deployment in predictive tasks related to the specified financial instrument and analysis interval."
